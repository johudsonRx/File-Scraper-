# File-Scraper-
A Python-Flask application that unzips gzip files, dumps the data in text files, and then allows API requests to be made to POST, GET, UPDATE, or DELETE entries from the text files into a database.

Practice of python and flask starting out with a lighter database. Refactoring and architecture changes are being made in the refactor branch.

To Do:
 -Configure with sqlalchemy instead for orm.
 -Create helper/util files to store logic (as opposed to keeping it in the server file)
 -Decrease the complexity of a few get methods
 -Replace sole ifs with ifs and elifs
 -Split lines before iterations
 -Write  unittests
 -Write more in depth error handling.

To Run:

 ./script.bash
