# File-Scraper-
A Python-Flask application that unzips gzip files, dumps the data in text files, and then allows API requests to be made to POST, GET, UPDATE, or DELETE entries from the text files into a database.

To Do:
 -Configure with a heavier database
 -Create helper/util files to store logic (as opposed to keeping it in the server file), 
 -Decrease the complexity of a few get methods, 
 -Write  unittests, 
 -Write more in depth error handling.

To Run:

 ./script.bash
